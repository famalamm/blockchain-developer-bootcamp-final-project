I would like to use blockchain technology to create a system in which parents within a certain school district can track down which buses will be picking up/dropping off their children. I would also like to use blockchain technology in order for parents to be able to know where each bus is with an estimated amount of time until their stop is reached. With blockchain technology, every parent will have a copy of the buses assigned to their school district/school/bus-stop. If a bus is late to the show, parents are also able to file complaints through the dapp that notifies the school/bus lot assigned to that particular bus.
Users would first be directed to the hompage where they will have to sign-up with a username, name, state, and zip code. Once they are inside, they must choose a particular school district based on the zipcode and state they gave prior. After choosing a school district, they then choose a school from a list of schools closest to the zipcode they gave earlier. Once a school is chosen, a list of buses from that school will be shown. Users will then input a specific bus-stop address to filter out buses that drop-off in areas further from them. The remaining buses on the screen are the buses suitable for their child to ride.
